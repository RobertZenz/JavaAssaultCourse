If you want to contribute, please consider the following:

 1. The source code is in UTF-8 with UNIX line-breaks.
 2. The source code should be well formatted with the attached formatter.
 3. There must be a short introduction in the documentation of the class,
    and a solution file (containing an explanation and the solution).
    Each example/exercise should be self-contained and executable.
 4. Limit the examples/exercises to practical problems, try to stay away from
    obscure trivia and cornercases. Or at least clearly state so in
    the description/documentation.
