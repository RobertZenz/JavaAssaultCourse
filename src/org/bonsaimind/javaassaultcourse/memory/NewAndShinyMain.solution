What it does
------------

This program does iterate over all numbers up to 100,000, turns them into
a string and concatenates these strings together. It outputs the length of
the string and the time it took. 


Problems
--------

The problem here is that concatenating strings is an expensive operation.
Because strings are immutable, eveyr concatenation must create a new object,
let's assume the following code:

    String c = a + b;

Which results roughly in the following operations:

 1. A new `String`, `c`, with the size of `a` and `b` is created.
 2. The content of `a` is copied into `c`.
 3. The content of `c` is copied into `c`.

That means that for a short amount of time memory in the size of `(a + b) * 2`
is required for the operation.


StringBuilder
-------------

The answer is to use something which does not create unnecessary memory and
garbage, and the answer is `StringBuilder`. It allows to "dynamically" create
a string without constantly creating new strings.


The refactoring
---------------

This program is easily refactored by replacing the string `numbers` with
a `StringBuilder`.

    StringBuilder numbers = new StringBuilder();
    
    for (int counter = 0; counter < 100_000; counter++) {
        numbers.append(counter);
    }
    
    System.out.println(numbers.length());

We see that it runs in a fraction of the original runtime. That is because the
new strings are appended to an already existing buffer instead of constantly
creating new strings.

The next step would be to strip out the concatenation part at all, as we can
do the same with simply counting the length.

    int length = 0;
    
    for (int counter = 0; counter < 100_000; counter++) {
        length = length + Integer.toString(counter).length();
    }
    
    System.out.println(length);

And again it does run a lot faster. This does still create one string for each
iteration, but the difference to the original implementation is that no
additional string with the "full size" of the complete string is created.

As we know the range, another possible way is to use an `if` cascade, like this:

    int length = 0;
    
    for (int counter = 0; counter < 100_000; counter++) {
        if (counter > 9_999) {
            length = length + 5;
        } else if (counter > 999) {
            length = length + 4;
        } else if (counter > 99) {
            length = length + 3;
        } else if (counter > 9) {
            length = length + 2;
        } else {
            length = length + 1;
        }
    }
    
    System.out.println(length);

And again, this runs a lot faster without allocating strings at all.
